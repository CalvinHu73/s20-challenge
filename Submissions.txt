1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?
    I spent about 2 hours learning HTML CSS and JS through a tutorial.
    I spent about 5 hours between coding, googling and debugging.
2. Describe the features you have implemented.
    My code allows addition of questions and options.
    If the actionListeners were added, I believe that the invariant that at most one
    option is selected per question will hold.
    I also implemented the GUI
3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
    I have no web dev experience and thus, experienced a lot of bugs. I had problems adding
    actionListeners to my buttons. I am not sure why it is not working.
4. How much time do you think you can spend each week working for theDP Web Department?
    It depends on the week, but at least 3 hours, and up to 10.
5. (Optional) If there is anything you want to tell us, go ahead :)
    I enjoyed this challenge since it forced me to learn the basics of web development really quickly.
    If possible, could you tell me why my actionListeners aren't attaching to my buttons?
    Also, how would I implement the counts? I could do a bunch of if statements, but that would be ugly.
    Also, where could I have written cleaner code? Thank you, and hopefully I can join DP!
